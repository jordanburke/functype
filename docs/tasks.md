# Functype Improvement Ideas

This document contains a comprehensive list of potential improvement ideas for the Functype library. These ideas represent possible directions for the library but should be evaluated against the core principles of maintaining a lightweight, focused approach as outlined in the README.md and implemented according to the official ROADMAP.md timeline.

> **Note**: Not all ideas listed here will necessarily be implemented. Each should be evaluated based on:
>
> - Alignment with the "lightweight" philosophy of the library
> - Prioritization in the official ROADMAP.md
> - Value to users vs. complexity added
> - Maintenance burden

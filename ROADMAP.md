# Functype Roadmap (2025-2026)

This roadmap outlines the planned development path for the Functype library, focusing on expanding functionality, improving performance, ensuring API consistency, and enhancing TypeScript integration.

## Q2 2025: Core Functional Data Types

### Lazy Evaluation

- [ ] Implement `LazyList` / `Stream` for efficient processing of potentially infinite sequences
- [ ] Add common operations: `map`, `filter`, `take`, `drop`, etc.
- [ ] Implement memoization for evaluated values

### Validation Type

- [ ] Create `Validation` data type for applicative validation
- [ ] Support collecting multiple errors (unlike Either which short-circuits)
- [ ] Add utilities for combining validation results

### Performance Foundation

- [ ] Add memoization utilities for expensive function calls
- [ ] Implement a basic benchmarking suite for measuring performance
- [ ] Standardize performance metrics across data structures

## Q3 2025: Advanced Functional Patterns & Optimizations

### Monad Implementations

- [ ] Implement `Reader` monad for dependency injection
- [ ] Add `State` monad for managing state transformations
- [ ] Create `IO` monad for pure handling of side effects
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation and examples

### Performance Improvements

- [ ] Implement structural sharing for immutable collections
- [ ] Optimize recursive operations for large data structures
- [ ] Add performance comparison against other FP libraries

### Lenses & Optics

- [ ] Implement lens abstraction for immutable updates
- [ ] Add prism implementation for optional data
- [ ] Create utilities for composing lenses and prisms

## Q4 2025: TypeScript Enhancements & API Consistency

### TypeScript Integration

- [x] Add support for higher-kinded types
- [ ] Remove `any` from HKT
- [x] Implement branded/nominal types for stronger type safety
- [ ] Add type-level utilities using newer TypeScript features
- [ ] Leverage const type parameters and tuple manipulation

### API Normalization

- [ ] Review and standardize API across all modules
- [ ] Ensure consistent implementation of the Scala-inspired pattern
- [ ] Standardize import patterns (@imports throughout)
- [ ] Create migration guides for API changes

## Q1 2026: Testing, Documentation & Community Support

### Testing Expansion

- [ ] Add test coverage metrics and set coverage goals
- [ ] Expand property-based testing across all modules
- [ ] Create interoperability tests with popular libraries
- [ ] Add more specialized test cases for error handling

### Documentation & Examples

- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for all modules
- [ ] Create step-by-step migration guides from imperative to functional
- [ ] Add real-world examples showcasing practical applications
- [ ] Create tutorial sections for beginners

### Community Engagement

- [ ] Create contribution guidelines and templates
- [ ] Set up automated issue/PR handling
- [ ] Establish regular release schedule
- [ ] Add community forum/discussion platform

## Ongoing Priorities

### Compatibility

- [ ] Ensure compatibility with Node.js LTS versions
- [ ] Maintain browser compatibility
- [ ] Support for Deno and other runtimes
- [ ] Test with various bundlers (webpack, esbuild, etc.)

### Bundle Size

- [ ] Optimize tree-shaking
- [ ] Provide guidance on importing only needed modules
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring to CI/CD

### Community Feedback

- [ ] Regular review of GitHub issues and feature requests
- [ ] Prioritization based on community needs
- [ ] Transparent development process

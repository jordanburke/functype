# Task Implementation Analysis and Best Practices

This document provides a deep analysis of the Task implementation in functype, discussing its design considerations, trade-offs, and recommendations for effective usage.

## Overview of Task Implementation

The Task module provides a robust bridge between functional programming patterns and asynchronous operations. It offers a structured way to handle errors, cancellation, and progress tracking while maintaining type safety.

Key features include:

- Named task contexts for richer error information
- Explicit try/catch/finally semantics
- Interoperability with Promise-based code
- Cancellation support
- Progress tracking for long-running operations

## Advanced Design Considerations

### Error Context Propagation

**Current Behavior:**
When tasks are nested, the outer task's context (name, description) overwrites the inner task's context in error propagation:

```typescript
// If an error occurs in the inner task:
await Task({ name: "OuterTask" }).Async(async () => {
  return Task({ name: "InnerTask" }).Async(async () => {
    throw new Error("Inner error")
  })
})

// The error will have:
// - message: "Inner error"
// - name: "OuterTask" (not "InnerTask")
// - taskInfo: { name: "OuterTask", ... }
```

This happens because when the inner task's promise rejects, it's caught by the outer task, which wraps it in its own error context. This is technically correct from a runtime perspective but might be counterintuitive when debugging.

**Recommendation:**
Consider implementing an option to preserve the innermost error context:

```typescript
// Possible enhancement
const preserveErrorContext = true
await Task({ name: "OuterTask", preserveErrorContext }).Async(...)

// Which would yield an error with:
// - Error context: "InnerTask" (preserved from inner task)
// - Original context chain: ["OuterTask", "InnerTask"] (for tracing)
```

### Asynchronous Edge Cases

Some asynchronous patterns can create complexity in error handling, particularly around cancellation and finally blocks:

**Potential Issues:**

1. Race conditions between cancellation signals and operation completion
2. Callback execution order with finally blocks and cancellation
3. Resource cleanup timing in complex async flows

**Recommendations:**

- Use explicit state machines for complex task flows
- Implement deterministic callback ordering guarantees
- Add explicit resource tracking for critical operations

```typescript
// Structured resource pattern example
Task.withResource(
  () => openResource(),
  (resource) => useResource(resource),
  (resource) => closeResource(resource),
)
```

### Performance Considerations

Task operations add some overhead compared to native Promises:

1. **Extra Promise wrapping** - Each Task operation creates additional Promise layers
2. **Error conversion** - Converting to Throwable objects has a small cost
3. **Context maintenance** - Task metadata is carried throughout the operation
4. **Cancellation checks** - Additional checks during execution

**Recommendations:**

- Use the Task API selectively for operations where the benefits outweigh costs
- Consider a lightweight mode for performance-critical paths:

```typescript
// Hypothetical lightweight mode
const lightTask = Task.light()
lightTask.Async(...) // Minimal overhead, fewer features
```

- Group multiple small tasks into larger task units to amortize overhead

## Cancellation Best Practices

The cancellation system is cooperative rather than preemptive, meaning tasks must actively check for cancellation:

### Effective Cancellation Patterns

```typescript
// 1. Regular checking pattern
Task.cancellable(async (token) => {
  for (const item of largeDataset) {
    // Check cancellation periodically
    if (token.isCancelled) {
      return // Exit early
    }

    // Process item
    await processItem(item)
  }
})

// 2. Integration with fetch and DOM APIs
Task.cancellable(async (token) => {
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    signal: token.signal, // AbortSignal integration
  })
  return await response.json()
})

// 3. Custom cancellation behavior
Task.cancellable(async (token) => {
  let resources = []

  token.onCancel(() => {
    // Clean up resources when cancelled
    resources.forEach((r) => r.dispose())
  })

  // Main task work...
})
```

### Cancellation Caveats

1. **Cancellation is not guaranteed to be immediate** - Tasks may continue briefly after cancellation
2. **External resources may need explicit cleanup** - Database connections, file handles, etc.
3. **Third-party APIs may not support cancellation** - Wrapping them requires careful handling

## Progress Tracking

For long-running operations, progress tracking provides visibility:

```typescript
// Basic progress usage
const { task, currentProgress } = Task.withProgress(
  async (updateProgress) => {
    updateProgress(0) // Start

    // Do work in chunks
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      await doChunk(i)
      updateProgress((i + 1) * 10) // 10%, 20%, etc.
    }

    return result
  },
  (percent) => {
    // Update UI with progress
    updateProgressBar(percent)
  },
)

// Combined with cancellation
const { task, cancel, currentProgress } = Task.withProgress(async (updateProgress, token) => {
  // Both progress tracking and cancellation
})
```

### Progress Implementation Considerations

1. **Progress granularity** - Too frequent updates can impact performance
2. **Cancellation interaction** - Progress should stop updating when cancelled
3. **Indeterminate phases** - Some operations can't report precise progress

## Advanced Task Composition

### Task Racing

The `Task.race` functionality allows racing multiple tasks against each other with optional timeout:

```typescript
// Race with timeout
const raceResult = await Task.race([slowOperation(), fastOperation()], 1000) // 1 second timeout
```

### Potential Future Composition Enhancements

1. **Structured Concurrency**

```typescript
// Hypothetical API
const { results, errors } = await Task.scope(async (scope) => {
  // All tasks in scope have linked lifecycle
  const task1 = scope.spawn(operation1())
  const task2 = scope.spawn(operation2())

  return await scope.join() // Wait for all to complete or fail
})
```

2. **Resource Management**

```typescript
// Hypothetical API for guaranteed resource cleanup
await Task.using(
  () => openDatabase(), // Acquire
  async (db) => {
    // Use resource
    return await db.query()
  },
  (db) => db.close(), // Always called
)
```

## Testing Considerations

Testing Task-based code requires special attention:

1. **Time and async flow control** - Use timeouts and explicit resolutions
2. **Cancellation testing** - Test both normal and cancelled paths
3. **Progress testing** - Verify progress reporting accuracy
4. **Error context verification** - Check error details are preserved

Example property tests:

```typescript
// Task Async should satisfy monad laws
test("Right identity: t.Async(f) >>= id = t.Async(f)", () => {
  fc.assert(
    fc.property(fc.string(), async (value) => {
      const f = async () => value
      const taskResult = await Task().Async(f)
      const directResult = await f()
      return taskResult === directResult
    }),
  )
})
```

## Integration with Other Patterns

Tasks work especially well when combined with other functional patterns:

### With Option

```typescript
// Convert nullable API response to Option
const getUserOption = async (id: string) => {
  const response = await Task().Async(async () => {
    return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
  })

  return Option.fromNullable(response)
}
```

### With Either

```typescript
// Type-specific error handling
const result = await Task().Async(async () => {
  // Operation returning Either<ApiError, UserData>
})

// Handle specific error types
result.match({
  left: (error) => handleApiError(error),
  right: (data) => useData(data),
})
```

## Conclusion

The Task implementation offers a powerful approach to functional asynchronous programming. By understanding its design trade-offs and following best practices, developers can create more robust, maintainable code with better error handling.

Remember that Task is not a replacement for all Promise usage - evaluate when the additional features justify the slightly increased complexity and overhead.

# Functype - A Functional Library for TypeScript

Functype is a functional programming library for TypeScript, inspired by FP, Scala's standard library and ZIO. It offers a collection of utilities and abstractions to facilitate functional programming paradigms within TypeScript applications. The library is designed to provide developers with tools that promote immutability, pure functions, and composability, aligning with functional programming principles.

## Key Features

- **Functional Utilities:** Functype includes a variety of functions and combinators that assist in writing functional code, such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` operations tailored for TypeScript.

- **Type Safety:** Leveraging TypeScript's type system, Functype ensures that functional operations are type-safe, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code reliability.

- **Immutability Support:** The library emphasizes immutable data structures, encouraging developers to write predictable and side-effect-free code.

- **Type Orientation:** Functype encourages TypeScript developers to adopt functional programming principles through type annotations and type inference.

- **Composability:** Functype provides a collection of abstractions and utilities for composing complex functional programs.

## Installation

You can install `functype` using any package manager:

```bash
npm install functype
```

```bash
